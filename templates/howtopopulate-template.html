        <p>a python script is developed to normalize the input addresses. This script could be viewed <a href="http://128.31.25.48:8881/notebooks/jovyan/work/normalize.py" target="_blank">here </a>. The script expects the addresses to be relatively cleaned and the parcel id's assigned to each row.</p> 
        <p>two python modules: <a href="http://128.31.25.48:8881/edit/jovyan/work/address_normalizer.py">address_normalizer</a> and <a href="http://128.31.25.48:8881/edit/jovyan/work/objData.py">objData</a> should be located in working directory. If using the jupyter notebook in the above link, it's located in Jupyter's home directory.</p>
        
        <p>the task of the script is to read the input addresses, and after normalizing them, to make a call to the document service then importing to elasticsearch.</p>
